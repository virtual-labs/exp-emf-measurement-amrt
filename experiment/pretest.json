      "question": "In an electrochemical cell _____ occurs at anode and _____ occurs at cathode",
      "answers": {
        "a": "reduction, oxidation",
        "b": "two of these are possible, depending on whether the cell is electrolytic or voltaic.",
        "c": "oxidation, oxidation",
        "d": "reduction, reduction",
        "e": "oxidation, reduction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Oxidation occurs at the anode, not reduction.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The given question assumes a standard electrochemical cell setup.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Oxidation cannot occur at both electrodes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Reduction cannot occur at both electrodes.",
        "e": "Correct. Oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode."

      "question": "The standard hydrogen electrode is assigned a potential of _____ volts",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0",
        "b": "+2",
        "c": "+1",
        "d": "-2",
        "e": "-1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The standard hydrogen electrode is defined to have zero potential by convention.",
        "b": "Incorrect. +2V is not the standard potential.",
        "c": "Incorrect. +1V is not correct for SHE.",
        "d": "Incorrect. -2V is not the standard potential.",
