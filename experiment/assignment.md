    <strong>Electrolysis problem:</strong> 100 mL of a neutral solution containing 0.2 g of copper was electrolysed until all the copper was deposited. The current was maintained at 1.2 A and the solution volume stayed 100 mL. Assuming 100% faradaic efficiency, find the time taken for complete deposition of copper. (Atomic weight of Cu = 63.58 g·mol<sup>−1</sup>.)

  <li>
    The standard reduction potentials of the <strong>Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Cu</strong> and <strong>Ag<sup>+</sup>/Ag</strong> electrodes are +0.34 V and +0.80 V respectively. (a) Construct a galvanic cell using these half-cells and state the cell notation and expected cell reaction. (b) For what concentration of Ag<sup>+</sup> will the emf of the cell at 25 °C be zero if [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] = 0.01 M?

  <li>
    Calculate the maximum (reversible) electrical work obtainable from the Daniel cell (Zn | Zn<sup>2+</sup> || Cu<sup>2+</sup> | Cu) using the standard free energies of formation (or absolute free energies) given for Zn(s), Cu(s), Cu<sup>2+</sup>(aq) and Zn<sup>2+</sup>(aq). Given that $E^0_{Zn^{2+}/Zn}$ and $E^0_{Cu^{2+}/Cu}$ are -0.76 and +0.34 V respectively.
  </li>

  <li>
    For a Daniel cell, the standard free energies (ΔG°) are given as: Zn(s) = 0 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup>, Cu(s) = 0 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>(aq) = +64.4 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>(aq) = −154.0 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup>. Using these values, calculate the standard EMF E° of the cell.
